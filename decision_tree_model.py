Predict customer churn using a decision tree model.

To-Do List:

Load Data:

Retrieve customer data from MySQL.
Prepare features and labels (e.g., churn_status as the target variable).
Train-Test Split:

Split data into training and testing sets.
Ensure data is balanced or apply resampling if needed.
Train Decision Tree Model:

Train a decision tree classifier using Scikit-learn.
Tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
Model Evaluation:

Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Print and log evaluation metrics.
Save the Model:

Save the trained model to a file using joblib or pickle.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling for model training and evaluation steps.
Ensure the script fails gracefully and logs errors.
