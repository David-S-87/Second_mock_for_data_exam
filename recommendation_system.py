'''
Load Clustered Data:

Retrieve customer cluster labels from the MySQL database or clustering results.
Customer Similarity Matching:

Create a function to find similar customers within the same cluster.
Match based on attributes like purchase history or product categories.
Recommendation Logic:

Recommend products that similar customers have purchased but the target customer hasnâ€™t.
Implement a scoring system to rank recommendations.
Modular Functions:

Define recommend() and match_customers() functions with clear docstrings.
Ensure easy integration with other parts of the project.
Exception Handling:

Handle cases where customer data or recommendations are unavailable.
Provide fallback messages or default recommendations.
